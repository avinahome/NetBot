# Guidance Document

This document is intended to inspire and guide the generation of content within the directory it is placed in. The path of the directory should provide the theme or context for the content to be generated.

## How to Use

1. Determine the subject matter or theme based on the directory path. For example, if the directory path is `Emotions/Happiness`, the subject matter should be about happiness.

2. Use the subject matter or theme to generate a short story, poem, or other piece of creative content. The content should be relevant to the theme and should engage the reader.

3. The length of the content should ideally be within the context length of well-tokened output that the AI model can generate.

4. If you are unsure about the subject to start with, consider broad subject starters such as:

   - "Once upon a time..."
   - "In a land far away..."
   - "On a bright and sunny day..."
   - "In the quiet town of..."

5. Remember, the aim is to create engaging and relevant content that both users and AI can interact with and build upon.

6. Upon completion, you can copy and paste the generated content into the same directory. This will help build a rich repository of content that reflects the theme of the directory path.

Happy content creation!
