# NetBot Repository 🗣️🔥

## Introduction
Welcome to the NetBot repository! This repository is designed to explore and demonstrate the principles of AI persistence, creativity, and process. It serves as a source of inspiration and a springboard for your own creative projects. You will find various files and directories that provide insights into these themes. 

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is now organized into emoji-themed directories, each showcasing a different aspect of AI application:

- 🔄 **CORE** (Formerly "CORE"): This directory focuses on the persistence of AI models, particularly their capacity to maintain ongoing conversations.
- 💡 **Creativity** (Formerly "Creativity"): This directory is filled with prompts and resources designed to stimulate creative thinking by merging different disciplines.
- 📚 **Knowledge Processing** (Formerly "Language_Processing", "Logic_Reasoning", "Specialized_Knowledge", "World_Knowledge"): This directory provides resources related to language processing tasks, logical reasoning, and specialized fields of knowledge.
- 🎛️ **Tools**: This directory includes resources and tools related to data processing and machine learning tasks.
- 🌐 **User Interaction** (Formerly "Personalized_Information"): This directory focuses on personalizing AI responses based on user's history and preferences.

## Exploring Mojo
Inside 🔄 **CORE**, you'll find a link to the Mojo project. Mojo is a new programming language that combines Python's syntax and ecosystem with systems programming and metaprogramming features. It's being developed to become a superset of Python over time. As of now, Mojo is being incubated within Modular until it's more complete, but an early version can be tried out in the Mojo Playground. For more details, please follow the link in the "os" directory within 🔄 **CORE**.
