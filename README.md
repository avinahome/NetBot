NetBot
NetBot is a project that aims to explore and demonstrate the principles of AI persistence and creativity. It provides various files and directories that offer insights into these concepts. This repository serves as a source of inspiration and as a springboard for your own creative projects.

Directories and Files
CORE: This directory contains a narrative about an AI model's persistence in maintaining a conversation. The main file, AI persistence.sty, describes how an AI model takes the output from one cycle as input for the next to keep a conversation going, thereby demonstrating a form of "persistence" in AI behavior.

Creativity: This directory contains prompts intended to encourage the generation of novel, creative ideas by combining concepts from different fields. The subdirectory "Combinational Creativity" features a range of prompts aimed at sparking innovative thoughts by merging different disciplines. For instance, one prompt asks you to consider how principles from the world of game design could be applied to improve the educational system, focusing on aspects such as engagement, rewards, and progression.
