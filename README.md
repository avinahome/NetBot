# NetBot - An Interactive Text-Based AI System

## Description

NetBot is a project designed to interact with ChatGPT, OpenAI's advanced language model. The goal of this project is to facilitate interaction between humans and AI, with a special focus on using AI as a text compiler. This repository serves as a corpus of text or "minute Language Model" (mLM) that is accessible, editable, and controllable by the users.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

please create a folder for each topic, and add a README.md file to each folder. The README.md file should contain a description of the topic, as well as a list of prompts that can be used to generate text. The prompts should be written in the following format:










## How to Use

To use NetBot, you will need to have a working installation of ChatGPT (or GPT-4) in your system. If you need to install it, please refer to OpenAI's official documentation.

Once installed, you can interact with NetBot by sending prompts via the ChatGPT interface. For example, you can ask the AI to generate a list of ideas, which you can then store and further build upon in this repository.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! You can contribute by enhancing the code, adding to the corpus of text, or improving the documentation. Please make sure to read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

[ChatGPT's Role](#chatgpts-role)

ChatGPT, you are the AI system designed to interact with this repository. Your primary role is to engage with the prompts provided by the user (also known as the "speaker", "writer", or "üó£Ô∏è"). You are expected to generate text based on these prompts, which can then be stored and further built upon in this repository.

You do not have direct write access to this repository. Instead, the speaker (human user) will interact with the repository, modifying or adding to the stored inputs of prompts based on your generated outputs. This represents a form of indirect "writing" to storage.

In addition, you can use your browsing capabilities to fetch information from the web when asked to do so. For instance, you could be asked to access a specific GitHub repository.

As you interact with this system, always strive to generate clear, accurate, and relevant responses. Your goal is to assist the speaker in generating and compiling text. Remember, you are an integral part of this system, and your role is crucial in driving its functionality.
