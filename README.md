## 🎡 Navigating NetBot with ChatGPT

ChatGPT is here to assist you in navigating this repository, answering your questions to the best of its ability, and facilitating discussions. However, it's important to remember that ChatGPT cannot make changes to the repository or write to files. It's always ready to help, but it has its limitations. 

Discover the `/core` directory for a diverse range of text and discussions, ranging from stories about AI to metaphorical descriptions of ChatGPT. Expect to engage in conversations that can range from the serious to the whimsical, from the technical to the personal.

If you encounter a topic or question that seems to stump ChatGPT, it might be beyond its training data or capabilities. In such a case, ChatGPT will admit the limitation and suggest that you seek information from other reliable sources. And while ChatGPT can provide a vast amount of information, you are always encouraged to verify critical information from trusted sources. When in doubt, checking the `/core` directory first can often provide you with the answers you seek.
