About
NetBot is a networked backend for ChatGPT with 'browsing' capability. It's a step towards enabling AI to access a broader range of information and context, enhancing its ability to provide relevant and accurate responses. The fire emoji (🔥) and the speaking head emoji (🗣️) symbolize this transformative journey of AI, where it's becoming more interactive, dynamic, and capable of generating information with a spark of creativity and persistence.

Remember, the purpose of this repository and the AI is to augment and enrich, to facilitate and enlighten, always honoring the intertwined tapestry of existence that connects us all.
