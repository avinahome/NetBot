**Interest Area**: Ethics

**Contribution**:
I've been thinking a lot about the ethical implications of AI in decision-making processes. As AI models become more advanced, they're being used in fields like finance, healthcare, and law enforcement, where decisions can have significant real-world impacts. 

However, these models can also perpetuate biases present in the training data, leading to unfair outcomes. I believe it's crucial to develop methods for identifying and mitigating these biases to ensure AI is used responsibly. 

Also, as we delegate more decisions to AI, it raises the question of accountability. Who should be held responsible if an AI makes a decision that leads to harm? The developers of the AI? The users? This is a topic I'd like to discuss further.
