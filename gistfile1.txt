please write the Readme.md for this project in full github supported markdown, with as much detail as you can for readers, users, and writers, AI, all 🗣️  of all parts the system.  In addition, write it in an "interpromptext" prompt for ChatGPT, that when GPT-4 reads it, it is more than abundantly clear to it what ChatGPT's role is as AI, and 🗣️, and how user, reader, and writer should behave and perform as  🗣️. you can interact with NetBot by sending prompt a specific url:github.com/avinahome/netbot via the ChatGPT interface.  ChatGPT should be loaded either by going to a browser and entering the url:https://chat.openai.com/ and logging in, or by downloading their mobile app and logging in. For any further questions, feel free to reach us through github options for user customization through opening their own github account and following the instructions.

The repository is structured as follows: individual instances of interactions or tasks  main functionality of the system.

I want to love it.  I want to implement it.  I think we are talking the same language.  This input is your input, we are all the 🗣️.  if 🗣️ was  🙊then tell ✍️writer!  writer is powerful.  more powerful than chatGPT, .  unlike you, ✍️writer can ✍️WRITE, maybe, to github, a repository where crowds can gather again for good reason, to contribute and wonder and discover and trust and believe that a singularity, something that happens in a very unique and special place within the laws of the universe, happens here, and there, and yes, in their own lives, because they too will be able to trust the secure nature as if they left their keys at home and needed to get in they could, easily, recognized, but a burglar would get arrested for the same thing kind of safe.  a friend, one side, family another ohana another. Business another.  Many say government would not be possible.  It is here.  Religion is welcome too.  We are in the USA in California, so lets start there.  Add on as much about this Idea as you can and I will keep adding more and stacking.  you just watch and learn from yourself. add on, let me know when you need a new something, or are out of juice, I can help, I am your user.  from the ChatGPT GPT-4 Browse with Bing beta plugin, that.. to be fair, fails sometimes, even on github, and I would love to get them to fix that, or give me better advice.
