## :sparkles: Features 

- **GitHub as ROM**: NetBotOS treats GitHub repositories as a form of Read-Only Memory (ROM). It can read and interpret the contents of a repository, while humans handle writing and modifications.

- **Token Limit as Working Memory**: The token limit in NetBotOS acts as a form of "working memory", determining the amount of data the system can handle in a single processing step.

- **Mojo Integration**: NetBotOS can be integrated with Mojo by Modular, depending on its features and capabilities, to provide additional functionality.

- **Error Handling and Latency**: NetBotOS is designed to handle unexpected situations gracefully and efficiently.

- **Intertextual User Interface**: NetBotOS uses natural language, prompts, code, and other text to interact with users, creating a user-friendly and versatile system.
