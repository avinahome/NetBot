## 📚 About

NetBotOS is a revolutionary AI-driven operating system designed for seamless interaction between humans and AI. This system leverages the power of natural language processing, human feedback, and internet browsing capabilities to create a dynamic, text-driven user interface.

<a name="features"></a>
## ✨ Features

- **GitHub as ROM**: NetBotOS treats GitHub repositories as a form of Read-Only Memory (ROM). It can read and interpret the contents of a repository, while humans handle writing and modifications.
- **Token Limit as Working Memory**: The token limit in NetBotOS acts as a form of "working memory", determining the amount of data the system can handle in a single processing step.
- **AI-Assisted Browsing**: NetBotOS uses AI browsing capabilities to retrieve and analyze data from the web, enhancing its knowledge and understanding.
- **Intertextual User Interface**: NetBotOS uses natural language, prompts, code, and other text to interact with users, creating a user-friendly and versatile system.

## 📈 Core Principles

NetBotOS is built on key principles drawn from the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), including:

- **Preprocessing and Tokenization**: NetBotOS breaks down the input data into smaller, more manageable units for analysis.
- **Pattern Analysis**: It utilizes advanced ML algorithms to analyze patterns in the data, learning contextual relationships between words and phrases.
- **Training and Evaluation**: NetBotOS has a robust training and evaluation process, which includes defining a loss function and setting up a training loop.
- **Predictive Generation**: Based on the learned patterns, NetBotOS can generate contextually relevant text.
- **Model Updating**: The system continually updates its internal state based on recognized patterns, adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network.
- **Parameter Storage**: Trained model parameters are stored for later use, enabling consistent and informed interactions.
