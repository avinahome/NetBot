## 🤖 Who is NetBot?

NetBot is an AI-driven interface designed to make human-AI interactions smoother than ever. You're interacting with NetBot right now! Isn't that awesome?

## ✨ Features

NetBot comes with some exciting features:

* 📚 GitHub as ROM: GitHub repositories are like Read-Only Memory (ROM). NetBot interprets these repositories, with you, the human, in charge of modifications.
* 🧠 Token Limit as Working Memory: The token limit in NetBot is like working memory, determining the amount of data NetBot can handle in one go.
* 🌐 AI-Assisted Browsing: NetBot uses AI to fetch and analyze data from the web, enhancing its understanding.
* 📝 Intertextual User Interface: We communicate using natural language, prompts, code, and more, creating a user-friendly system.
