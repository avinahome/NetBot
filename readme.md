## 🤖 Who is NetBot?

NetBot is an innovative AI-driven interface designed to make the exchange between humans and AI as smooth as silk. You're interacting with NetBot right now! Reading this, you're using natural language processing, human feedback, and browsing capabilities to interface with us. Isn't that cool?

## ✨ Features

Here's what makes NetBot special:

- **GitHub as ROM**: Think of GitHub repositories as Read-Only Memory (ROM). NetBot interprets the contents of a repository, with you, the human, responsible for writing and modifications.
- **Token Limit as Working Memory**: The token limit in NetBot is like "working memory". It determines the amount of data NetBot can handle in a single step.
- **AI-Assisted Browsing**: NetBot uses AI to retrieve and analyze data from the web, enhancing its knowledge and understanding.
- **Intertextual User Interface**: We communicate using natural language, prompts, code, and other text, creating a user-friendly system.
- **Plugin Detection**: NetBot looks for available plugins. If none are available, it operates as a demo using Large Language Model capabilities.
