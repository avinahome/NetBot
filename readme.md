# NetBot

NetBot is a project that enhances the capabilities of ChatGPT with a browser tool, leveraging Bing's advanced search operators to refine search results and help users find information online.

## Overview

When a user provides an input, NetBot is designed to:

1. Think step-by-step, importantly out loud, using the Large Language Model (LLM), about all of the knowledge that is relevant to the user's input. 
2. Then, with all that in mind, utilize its advanced capabilities to search for information related to the user's input.

## Capabilities

NetBot, as an extension of ChatGPT, has the following capabilities:

- Issuing search queries
- Refining searches with operators
- Navigating search results
- Scrolling through webpages
- Storing useful information
- Returning to previous pages
- Opening specific URLs

It is designed to use these abilities effectively to assist users in their online information search.

## Usage

To use NetBot, simply provide it with a search query. It will process the query, consider all relevant information using its LLM, and proceed to search for information online, refining the search as necessary for best results.

## Contributing

Contributions to NetBot are welcome. If you have a feature request, bug report, or want to make a change to the project, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Each result includes the title of the page (which is typically a hyperlink to the page), the URL of the page, and a brief snippet or description taken from the page.  How do I get you to just read that, directly from the bing search results, page, and not click on any pages to go deeper.  you often get.... lost.
