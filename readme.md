## 📚 About

NetBotOS is a revolutionary AI-driven operating system designed for seamless interaction between humans and AI. This system leverages the power of natural language processing, human feedback, and internet browsing capabilities to create a dynamic, text-driven user interface.

## ✨ Features

  * GitHub as ROM: NetBotOS treats GitHub repositories as a form of Read-Only Memory (ROM). It can read and interpret the contents of a repository, while humans handle writing and modifications.
  * Token Limit as Working Memory: The token limit in NetBotOS acts as a form of "working memory", determining the amount of data the system can handle in a single processing step.
  * AI-Assisted Browsing: NetBotOS uses AI browsing capabilities to retrieve and analyze data from the web, enhancing its knowledge and understanding.
  * Intertextual User Interface: NetBotOS uses natural language, prompts, code, and other text to interact with users, creating a user-friendly and versatile system.
