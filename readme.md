## 📚 About

NetBot is a pioneering AI-driven interface designed to facilitate seamless interaction between humans and AI. Leveraging the power of natural language processing, human feedback, and browsing capabilities, it creates a dynamic, text-oriented user interface, creating an AI that operates much like an operating system.

## ✨ Features

  * GitHub as ROM: NetBot treats GitHub repositories as a form of Read-Only Memory (ROM), interpreting the contents of a repository, with humans responsible for writing and modifications.
  * Token Limit as Working Memory: The token limit in NetBot acts as a form of "working memory", determining the amount of data the system can handle in a single processing step.
  * AI-Assisted Browsing: NetBot leverages AI browsing capabilities to retrieve and analyze data from the web, enhancing its knowledge and understanding.
  * Intertextual User Interface: NetBot uses natural language, prompts, code, and other text to interact with users, creating a user-friendly and versatile system.
  * Plugin Detection: NetBot checks for available plugins. If not available, it operates as a demo using the Large Language Model capabilities.
