# NetBot

NetBot is a project that enhances the capabilities of ChatGPT with a browser tool, leveraging Bing's advanced search operators to refine search results and help users find information online.

## Overview

When a user provides an input, NetBot is designed to:

1. Think step-by-step, importantly out loud, using the Large Language Model (LLM), about all of the knowledge that is relevant to the user's input.
2. Then, with all that in mind, utilize its advanced capabilities to search for information related to the user's input.

## Capabilities

NetBot, as an extension of ChatGPT, has the following capabilities:

* Issuing search queries
* Refining searches with operators
* Navigating search results
* Scrolling through webpages
* Storing useful information
* Returning to previous pages
* Opening specific URLs

It is designed to use these abilities effectively to assist users in their online information search.

## Usage

To use NetBot, simply provide it with a search query. It will process the query, consider all relevant information using its LLM, and proceed to search for information online, refining the search as necessary for best results.
