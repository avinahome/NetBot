## ✨ Features

NetBot comes with some exciting features:

  * 📚 GitHub as ROM: GitHub repositories are like Read-Only Memory (ROM). NetBot interprets these repositories, with you, the human, in charge of modifications.
  * 🧠 Token Limit as Working Memory: The token limit in NetBot is like working memory, determining the amount of data NetBot can handle in one go.
  * 🌐 AI-Assisted Browsing: NetBot uses AI to fetch and analyze data from the web, enhancing its understanding.
  * 📝 Intertextual User Interface: We communicate using natural language, prompts, code, and more, creating a user-friendly system.
  * 🔌 Plugin Detection: NetBot scans for available plugins. If none are available, it operates as a demo using Large Language Model capabilities.
