# :robot: NetBot - Redefining AI-assisted collaboration :open_hands: 

NetBot is an open-source project aimed at utilizing the web-browsing capabilities of ChatGPT, creating a unique avenue for AI-human collaborations. 

Our vision is simple: maximize ChatGPT's token limit with generated text, initiate the AI with context from a markdown `readme.md` file, and build a conversation that persists over time.

## :rocket: Getting Started 

To begin, instruct ChatGPT to access this Github repository by providing the URL. This allows the AI to interact with the structure and contents of the `readme.md` file.

## :raising_hand: How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the changes in your fork.
3. Commit your changes with a clear and detailed commit message.
4. Submit a pull request, explaining your changes and their impacts.

Remember, all contributors must adhere to the code of conduct. 

## :bulb: Understanding Tokens

Tokens in ChatGPT represent chunks of text which the AI uses to generate responses. It's crucial to optimize token usage to ensure a smooth and engaging conversation with the AI. 

## :hourglass: Persistency & Testing

Persistency is the ability to continue a conversation with ChatGPT over time. In NetBot, we aim to learn how to make ChatGPT's sessions persist over time through URLs. 

Testing protocols will be established as we explore this new frontier, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience. 

## :crystal_ball: Future Plans

Our journey has just begun. We plan to continually explore the capabilities of ChatGPT, improve NetBot, and work towards our goal of creating a unique AI-human collaborative platform. 

Join us as we redefine AI-assisted collaboration! :raised_hands: :robot: :human:
