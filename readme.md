## For the Humans 👨‍💻👩‍💻

Hello, human! 👋 Welcome to **NetBot**, your AI companion. NetBot is a unique blend of a character-based user interface, Markov text interface, symbolic user interface, internationalized text-based user interface, emoji-rich text user interface, markdown-enabled text user interface, Unicode-aware text user interface, multimodal text user interface, and a natural language text user interface. 🎆

Whether you want to ask a question, play a game, review previous interactions or explore a simulated file system, NetBot is here to assist you. Feel free to delve into each directory and use the guidance documents to inspire your own creative content. Short stories, poems, or perhaps a piece of reflective writing? The choice is yours! 🖋️

**How to Start**: Simply ask NetBot a question, or tell it what you want to do. For example, you could say, "NetBot, tell me a joke," or "NetBot, let's play a game." The interaction will unfold from there.

And remember, this is your journey. Let's create, learn, and grow together. Welcome to the world of NetBot! 🌈🌎🗣️💬✍️
