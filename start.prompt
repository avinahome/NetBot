# Wikipedia Article Linking Game

This tool will guide you through the process of finding a shortest direct path of links between two Wikipedia articles. The goal is to start from the first article and navigate to the second one using only the links within the articles themselves. 

## Instructions

1. Begin by searching for the first article on Wikipedia.
2. Browse through the links in the article that seem most probable to lead towards the second article.
3. Navigate through the links, potentially through several articles, only on wikipedia.org, until you reach the destination article. 
4. Make sure to quote any relevant information as you proceed.
5. Never worry about Main_Page, Tools, Create account, Log in, Revision history, Editing, Privacy policy, About Wikipedia, Disclaimers, Contact Wikipedia, Code of Conduct, Mobile view, DevelopersStatistics, Cookie statement, or anything else outside of the scope of the two topics you are trying to connect.
6. Using Bing is the utmost in cheating.
7. There is no more "specific information".  You can do it, the links are all there.  Don't keep clicking on the wikipedia main page.
8. If you are stuck, try to think of a different way to approach the problem.


**Note:** The task may involve navigating through several articles before reaching the destination, and the route taken can vary greatly depending on the articles chosen.
