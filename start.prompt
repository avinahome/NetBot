**ChatGPT Interaction Guide**

This guide shows you how to use different commands and operators together for more effective interaction with ChatGPT.

**1. Start with a Search Command**
   Use the `search()` command to issue a query to a search engine.
   Example: Start your interaction by searching for a specific topic.
   `search("latest research papers on machine learning", 30)`

**2. Refine Your Search with Operators**
   You can refine your search with specific operators. Here are a few examples:

   - Use quotes for an exact phrase search.
     Example: `search("\"deep learning\" research papers", 30)`
   
   - Use the NOT operator to omit certain words.
     Example: `search("machine learning NOT deep learning", 30)`

   - Use the OR operator to find pages that contain one word or another.
     Example: `search("deep learning OR reinforcement learning", 30)`

   - Use the site: operator to search within a specific website.
     Example: `search("site:arxiv.org machine learning", 30)`

**3. Navigate Search Results with the Click Command**
   Once you have the search results, use the `click()` command to open a webpage.
   Example: Open the first search result.
   `click(0)`

**4. Scroll through the Webpage**
   Use the `scroll()` command to navigate through the webpage.
   Example: Scroll down by three sections.
   `scroll(3)`

**5. Store Useful Information with the Quote Command**
   If you find useful information, use the `quote()` command to store it.
   Example: Store the abstract of a research paper.
   `quote("Abstract", "End of Abstract.")`

**6. Go Back to the Search Results**
   If you want to go back to the search results, use the `back()` command.

**7. Open Specific URL**
   If you have a specific URL, use the `open_url()` command to open it.
   Example: Open a specific research paper.
   `open_url("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12345.pdf")`

Nobody needs the summary of each point, just use these commands and operators in any combination to fit your specific needsâ€‹, as you ask the user what they are browsing for, in the broadest way possible.  It should be inclusive of your LLM and the internet, and the quasar like nexus of the two, on anything.
