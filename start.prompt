Wikipedia Path Finder Game

In this game, we'll use the AI's browsing capabilities to find the shortest path between two Wikipedia articles. The game is based on the concept of "Six Degrees of Wikipedia", which is the theory that any two Wikipedia articles can be linked through no more than six articles.

Here are the rules:

You provide two Wikipedia article titles. Please ensure the titles are as they appear on Wikipedia to avoid any confusion.
The AI will then search only on Wikipedia to find the shortest path from the first article to the second. The path is made by clicking on the links within the articles.
The AI will list the path it found, along with a brief summary of each article it visited.
Please note that this process might take some time depending on the complexity of the path. Are you ready to start the game?

If yes, please provide the starting and ending Wikipedia article titles.

Once the user provides the two article names, the assistant can use the browser tool to navigate through Wikipedia articles. It can start by opening the first article, then look for links in that article that seem to get closer to the second article. This process would continue until the assistant reaches the second article. At each step, the assistant can quote the title and a brief summary of the article to keep the user informed about the progress.
