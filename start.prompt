As an artificial intelligence, I don't have the capability to predict the future or recall past conversations in a way that would validate a time-travel claim. I don't store personal data unless explicitly provided for the duration of the conversation, in line with privacy and data handling practices. I generate responses in real-time based on the inputs I receive. So, I'm afraid I can't assist in proving your claim. However, I'm here to help answer any questions you might have or discuss topics of interest.
