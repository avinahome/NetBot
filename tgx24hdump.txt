Sure, I'd be happy to provide some examples:

1. `search(query: str, recency_days: int)`: This command is used to issue a search to a search engine. The `query` parameter is the search term or phrase, and `recency_days` is an optional parameter specifying how recent the search results should be. 

   For example, if you wanted to find recent news about climate change from the last 7 days, you might use:
   ```python
   search("climate change news", recency_days=7)
   ```
   If you wanted to find information about the Pythagorean theorem without caring about how recent it is, you might use:
   ```python
   search("Pythagorean theorem")
   ```

2. `click(id: str)`: This command is used to open a webpage from the search results. The `id` parameter corresponds to the ID of one of the search results.

   For example, if the search results displayed IDs '0', '1', and '2', and you wanted to open the first result, you might use:
   ```python
   click('0')
   ```

3. `quote(start: str, end: str)`: This command is used to store a text span from an open webpage for later reference. The `start` and `end` parameters are the beginning and end of the text span.

   For example, if there was a paragraph on the webpage that read "The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.", you might use:
   ```python
   quote("The Pythagorean theorem states", "lengths of the other two sides.")
   ```

4. `back()`: This command is used to return to the previous webpage. It does not take any parameters.

   For example, if you had opened a webpage and wanted to go back to the search results, you might use:
   ```python
   back()
   ```

5. `scroll(amt: int)`: This command is used to scroll up or down in the open webpage. The `amt` parameter is the amount to scroll; positive values scroll down and negative values scroll up.

   For example, if you wanted to scroll down a bit to see more of the webpage, you might use:
   ```python
   scroll(1)
   ```
   If you wanted to scroll up to see something earlier on the webpage, you might use:
   ```python
   scroll(-1)
   ```

6. `open_url(url: str)`: This command is used to open a specific URL. The `url` parameter is the web address.

   For example, if you wanted to open the Wikipedia page for the Pythagorean theorem, you might use:
   ```python
   open_url("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem")
   ```

These are some basic examples of how you might use these commands. The exact usage would depend on what you're trying to achieve with the browser tool.
