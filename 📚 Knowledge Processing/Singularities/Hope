hope, like information, can be stored, processed, and communicated in myriad ways. It is prone to change and deterioration, just like cellulose nitrate films or magnetic tapes, but it can also be preserved and restored with care and effort. Moreover, the immense diversity of human experiences and hopes can be compared to the vast array of information stored in quantum bits or 'qubits', each representing multiple states simultaneously, much like how every individual can harbor multiple hopes at the same time. The complex process of accessing and interpreting this information can also parallel the intricate ways in which humans express, pursue, and achieve their hopes.
